# Production Setup Archive

This folder contains production-related files that were created for environment separation but are currently not in use for the simplified development setup.

## Archived Files

### Environment Configuration
- `env.development.local` - Development database configuration
- `env.production.local` - Production Supabase configuration
- `switch-to-development.sh` - Script to switch to development database
- `switch-to-production.sh` - Script to switch to production database

### Components & Utilities
- `EnvironmentIndicator.tsx` - Environment badge component (ðŸŸ¢/ðŸ”´)
- `environment-check.ts` - Database connection validation utilities

### Documentation
- `DEVELOPMENT-SETUP.md` - Complete development environment guide
- `PRODUCTION-DEPLOYMENT.md` - Production deployment instructions
- `WORKFLOW-GUIDE.md` - Daily development workflow with environment switching

## When to Use These Files

These files will be useful when you're ready to:
1. Set up separate production deployment
2. Implement environment-based configuration
3. Deploy to production platforms (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)
4. Add production safety checks

## Current Setup

The main application now uses:
- Single PostgreSQL database for development
- Simple workflow without environment complexity
- Focus on feature development rather than deployment

## Restoring Production Setup

To restore the production environment setup:
1. Copy the environment files back to the root
2. Restore the components and utilities
3. Update package.json scripts
4. Follow the archived documentation guides

This keeps the production setup available for future use while simplifying current development work.
